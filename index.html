    <p>Post 1: My name is Selmane. I'm a computer programmer.</p>
    <h1>Topics i want to consider:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>machine learning ethics.</li>
      <li>Transports systems, Artifiicall intelligence and the city.</li>
          
    </ul> 
    <p>We're currently working on a in house built fare management system that needs to be interoperable; that means it should work with all transport operators. We're looking at different implementations from around the world and from the research community as well as following guidelines from ISO standard for Interoperable fare management systems, the endeavor is difficult but we are raising the bar and have undertaken this task. We are follwing proper SDLC methodologies. The benefits of building the solution internally are numerous, including building strong system development and maintenance competencies, control over the technology and building confidence in our ablilty to build such complex systems.    </p>
