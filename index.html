          We're currently working on a in house build in fare management system that needs to be interoperable that means it should work with all other operators. We're looking at different implementations from around the worlds and the research community as well as following guidelines from ISO standards for Interoperable fare management systems, the endeavor is difficult but we are raising the bar and have undertaken this task, and we are follwing proper SDLC methodologies. The benefits of building the solution internally are enormous, including building strong system development and maintenance competencies, control over the technology and building confidence in our ablilty to build such complex systems.    
    </ul>
